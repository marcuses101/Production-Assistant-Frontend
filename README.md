Used with the Production Assistant API, this React Application helps film producers keep their projects organized. Manage scenes, items, acquisitions. Keep track of the project's budget, status of the upcoming scene, and items left to acquire. 

## Overview

### Project

Add a new project, or select a previously created project from the list.

### Project Dashboard

Once a project selected the Project Dashboard will be shown, presenting varied information about the status of the project, as well as useful links around the app.

At any time, you can also use the side navigation to navigate around the application.

Accessible at any time by selecting "Overview" from the side navigation.

### Scene

Scenes make up the project. Each scene has a date indicating when the scene will be filmed. 
Details about the next upcoming scene are presented on the Project Dashboard.

Add scenes using the "Add Scene" page.
Edit or remove scenes by selecting a scene from the "Scenes"

Items can be associated to the scene on either the "Add Scene" or "Edit Scene" pages.

### Item

Items are any objects to be used in a scene. They should to be acquired via the "Shopping List" before the date of the scene. 

Add items using the "Add item" page. 
Edit or remove items by selecting an item from the "Item" card on the Project Dashboard.

### Shopping List

Keep track of the status of project items using the Shopping List, available from the side navigation. Here you can set the acquired status of project items, and track funds spent on the project.
